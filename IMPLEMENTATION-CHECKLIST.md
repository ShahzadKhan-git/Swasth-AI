# ‚úÖ Implementation Checklist - Next.js 15 + Supabase + Vercel

Use this checklist to ensure your deployment is successful and production-ready.

## üèóÔ∏è Pre-Deployment Setup

### Supabase Configuration
- [ ] Created Supabase project
- [ ] Ran `supabase-schema-production.sql` in SQL editor
- [ ] Verified `profiles` table exists with RLS enabled
- [ ] Copied Project URL and anon key from Settings ‚Üí API
- [ ] Tested database connection in Supabase dashboard

### Local Development
- [ ] Copied all production files to correct locations
- [ ] Installed dependencies: `@supabase/supabase-js @supabase/ssr`
- [ ] Created `.env.local` with correct Supabase credentials
- [ ] Tested signup flow locally (`npm run dev`)
- [ ] Tested login flow locally
- [ ] Tested profile management locally
- [ ] Verified protected routes work locally

## üöÄ Deployment Setup

### Vercel Configuration
- [ ] Connected Git repository to Vercel (or using Vercel CLI)
- [ ] Set environment variables in Vercel dashboard:
  - [ ] `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
  - [ ] `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- [ ] Verified environment variables are set for Production, Preview, and Development
- [ ] Deployed to Vercel (`vercel --prod` or via Git push)

### Post-Deployment Verification
- [ ] Visited deployed URL successfully
- [ ] Tested signup flow on production
- [ ] Tested login flow on production
- [ ] Tested logout functionality
- [ ] Verified protected routes redirect correctly
- [ ] Tested profile creation and updates
- [ ] Checked browser console for errors
- [ ] Verified middleware is working (check redirects)

## üîß File Verification

### Core Files Present
- [ ] `/lib/supabaseClient.js` (runtime-safe version)
- [ ] `/middleware.js` (Vercel-compatible version)
- [ ] `/next.config.mjs` (production configuration)
- [ ] `/app/layout.jsx` (with AuthProvider)

### API Routes
- [ ] `/app/api/auth/signup/route.js`
- [ ] `/app/api/auth/login/route.js`
- [ ] `/app/api/auth/logout/route.js`
- [ ] `/app/api/auth/session/route.js`
- [ ] `/app/api/profile/route.js`

### Components
- [ ] `/components/auth/LoginForm.jsx`
- [ ] `/components/auth/SignupForm.jsx`
- [ ] `/components/profile/ProfileForm.jsx`
- [ ] `/hooks/useAuth.js`

### Pages
- [ ] `/app/auth/login/page.jsx`
- [ ] `/app/auth/signup/page.jsx`
- [ ] `/app/dashboard/page.jsx`
- [ ] `/app/profile/page.jsx`

## üß™ Testing Scenarios

### Authentication Flow
- [ ] **Signup**: New user can create account
- [ ] **Email verification**: Check if email confirmation is required
- [ ] **Login**: Existing user can sign in
- [ ] **Session persistence**: User stays logged in after page refresh
- [ ] **Logout**: User can sign out and is redirected appropriately

### Route Protection
- [ ] **Unauthenticated access**: `/dashboard` redirects to `/auth/login`
- [ ] **Authenticated access**: `/auth/login` redirects to `/dashboard`
- [ ] **Direct URL access**: Protected routes require authentication
- [ ] **Middleware function**: Routes are properly protected/unprotected

### Profile Management
- [ ] **Profile creation**: New users can create profiles
- [ ] **Profile updates**: Users can update their information
- [ ] **Data persistence**: Profile changes are saved to database
- [ ] **Error handling**: Invalid data shows appropriate errors

### Error Handling
- [ ] **Invalid credentials**: Shows proper error message
- [ ] **Network errors**: Handles connection issues gracefully
- [ ] **Missing environment variables**: Fails gracefully with helpful message
- [ ] **Database errors**: Shows user-friendly error messages

## üîç Performance & Security

### Performance Checks
- [ ] **Build success**: `npm run build` completes without errors
- [ ] **Page load speed**: Pages load quickly (< 3 seconds)
- [ ] **Bundle size**: No unnecessary large dependencies
- [ ] **Hydration**: No hydration mismatch errors in console

### Security Verification
- [ ] **RLS enabled**: Row Level Security is active on all tables
- [ ] **Environment variables**: No secrets exposed in client-side code
- [ ] **Input validation**: Forms validate user input properly
- [ ] **HTTPS**: All requests use HTTPS in production
- [ ] **CORS**: Supabase allows requests from your domain

## üö® Common Issues & Solutions

### Build/Deployment Issues
- [ ] **Environment variables not found**: Check Vercel dashboard settings
- [ ] **Middleware errors**: Ensure using the simplified production middleware
- [ ] **Import errors**: Verify all file paths are correct
- [ ] **Dependency issues**: Run `npm install` and check package.json

### Runtime Issues
- [ ] **Supabase connection fails**: Verify URL and key are correct
- [ ] **Authentication not working**: Check RLS policies and table structure
- [ ] **Redirects not working**: Verify middleware configuration
- [ ] **Profile operations fail**: Check database permissions and schema

### User Experience Issues
- [ ] **Loading states**: All forms show loading indicators
- [ ] **Error messages**: Users see helpful error messages
- [ ] **Success feedback**: Users get confirmation of successful actions
- [ ] **Mobile responsiveness**: App works on mobile devices

## üìä Production Monitoring

### Post-Launch Monitoring
- [ ] **Error tracking**: Set up error monitoring (Sentry, etc.)
- [ ] **Analytics**: Track user signup/login rates
- [ ] **Performance monitoring**: Monitor page load times
- [ ] **Database usage**: Monitor Supabase usage and limits

### Maintenance Tasks
- [ ] **Regular backups**: Ensure Supabase data is backed up
- [ ] **Dependency updates**: Keep packages up to date
- [ ] **Security patches**: Apply security updates promptly
- [ ] **Performance optimization**: Monitor and optimize as needed

## ‚úÖ Final Verification
